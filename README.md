Consider it a stripped version of Medium. This repository is a first step in learning how to build an api server, whilst integrating it with a React frontend.
This approach is in contrast to [ESReads](https://github.com/Afekhide/esreads) where everything was done using Jinja2 templates. The frontend is available at [Blogr frontend](https://github.com/Afekhide/Blogr-Frontend)

## **Stack** ##
1. Python
